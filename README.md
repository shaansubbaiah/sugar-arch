# Sugar 0.116+ and daily builds for Arch Linux

## How to install

### Stable
```
cd stable
chmod +x autoinstall.sh
./autoinstall.sh
```

### Dev 
```
cd dev
chmod +x autoinstall.sh-git
./autoinstall.sh-git
```

## Support
Please help sugar packages to get it into the Arch Repositories. The current package is 0.114 and may not work after the Python2 deprecation. These packages on the AUR have been filed to be deleted by another developer. Looking forward for help. :)
